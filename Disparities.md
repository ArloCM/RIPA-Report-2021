One of BPD's main concerns is the potential for police activity to disproportionately impact Black and Brown communities in Berkeley. The first graph below shows the volume of stops. One of the hardest parts of evaluating racial disparities in stop data is selecting the correct baseline to compare to. Ideally, we would be able to compare the demographics of who gets stopped to the demographics of who is threatening public safety at a given time of day, but the best we can do is to use the resident demographics of Berkeley and surrounding areas. Select a demographic baseline from the left sidebar to use the different demographic baseline that you think is most relevant, or select "Count" from the dropdown to see the total stop volume. The second graph looks at the ratio of stops of Black people compared to stops of White people- a measure above 1 indicates that Black people are stopped more often than White people using the demographic baseline you've selected. Use the filters in the sidebar to look at a subset of stops, and click on the graphs' legends to reveal additional trend lines.
