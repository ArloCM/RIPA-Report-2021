One of BPD's main concerns is the potential for police activity to disproportionately impact minoritized communities in Berkeley. The first graph below shows the volume of stops. One of the hardest parts of evaluating racial disparities in stop data is selecting the correct baseline to compare to. Ideally, we would be able to compare the demographics of who gets stopped to the demographics of who is threatening public safety on the road or sidewalk at a given time of day, but the best we can do is to use the resident demographics of Berkeley and surrounding areas. Select a demographic baseline from the left sidebar to use the different demographic baseline that you think is most relevant. Click on the graphs' legends to reveal additional trend lines.
