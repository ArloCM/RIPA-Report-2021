### Yield Rate Analysis

In the graph below, we compare the yield rate of searches of Black people compared to searches of White people. A yield rate ratio of 1:1 would indicate that officers are deciding to search based on race-neutral factors. A yield rate above 1 would indicate that searches of Black people are less likely to yield contraband, while a yield rate below 1 indicates that searches of White people yield contraband less often.
