### Yield Rate Analysis

One measure of whether officer discretion is influenced by implicit racial bias is a yield rate analysis. Typically, yield rate analyses try to measure whether the officer’s decision to search is subject to a lower threshold of suspicion for minorities as compared to for white people. The yield rate analysis is based on the assumption that race neutral indicators observable by an officer will accurately predict the probability that a search will turn up contraband. The logic follows that a search triggered by a given level of suspicion based on race-neutral factors will ‘yield’ contraband at the same rate across racial groups. Conversely, a lower yield rate for white people as compared to black people would indicate that officers are searching white people with a higher confidence of finding contraband. The outcome of a search is a better measure of implicit bias than the outcome of a stop because contrary to the decision to stop, an officer always knows the race of the subject at the time of the decision to search.

In the graph below, we compare the yield rate of searches of Black people compared to searches of White people. A yield rate ratio of 1:1 would indicate that officers are deciding to search based on race-neutral factors. A yield rate above 1 would indicate that searches of Black people are less likely to yield contraband, while a yield rate below 1 indicates that searches of White people yield contraband less often.
