## Overview

The overall outcomes disparity can be caused by factors that fall within BPDâ€™s control and others that are outside their realm of influence. Institutional drivers of disparity could include discretion in the decision to stop and search and inequitable deployment of police patrols across the city. External drivers of disparity include victim-described suspect descriptions and disparate rates of offending across demographic groups. 

Assigning a precise percentage of the stops disparity that each potential driver is responsible is difficult given our limited data and the complexity that interconnects these drivers; however, we can begin to identify which drivers are relatively important in the Berkeley context. For the factors outside of BPD control, we can make assumptions that allow us to identify high and low estimates of the portion of the disparity caused by those factors. This will give us a range within which we can measure our expectations for improvement driven by a BPD policy change. For factors within BPD control, we can look for a null result from either driver and use that finding to refine our policy recommendations. That is, if we find little evidence of officer discretion or deployment patterns contributing to the outcomes disparity, or conversely if the data suggests that either driver could be a factor, then we will know whether we ought to orient our policy recommendations towards one, the other or both.
