One method of determining whether officer discretion is influenced by implicit racial bias is try to measure whether the officer’s decision to search is subject to a lower threshold of suspicion for Black and Brown people as compared to for White people. Often called yield rate analysis, the method is based on the assumption that race neutral indicators observable by an officer will accurately predict the probability that a search will turn up contraband. The logic follows that a search triggered by a given level of suspicion based on race-neutral factors will ‘yield’ contraband at the same rate across racial groups. Conversely, a lower yield rate for searches of White people as compared to searches of Black people would indicate that officers are deciding to search White people when they have a higher confidence of finding contraband.
