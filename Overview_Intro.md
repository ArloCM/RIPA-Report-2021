This report is intended to give users an easier way to dive deep into the Berkeley Police Department's publicly available data on stops. Berkeley PD collects and publishes all data required by California's Racial and Identify Profiling Act and more. The department uses this information to track the impact that both calls for service and officer proactivity have on Berkeley community members.
